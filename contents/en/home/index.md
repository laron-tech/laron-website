# Laron Project

Decentralized digital platform.

## What is Laron?

![laron](/laron.svg)

Laron itself is the name of the project that we builds on the top of the Web3 and present it to the community.

The project itself is completely open so that anyone can contribute to the project. Even so, we have a [core team](#core-team) that is responsible for the projects we run.

## What we do?

![smart-contracts](/smart-contracts.png)

We conduct research and development that can help the community to make this technology easier to use and reach a wider range of users.

Web3 is a new technology that is still in its infancy, and we are glad to be able to contribute to the growth of this technology.
