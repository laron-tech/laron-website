Laron is an open source project that focused on developing <span>Platform</span> and <span>Ecosystem</span> on the top of [Web3](https://ethereum.org/en/web3/) technologies.

This project aims to provide a better experience in using <span>web3</span> technology. With the hope that we can help the development of this technology, and reach a wider range of users.

With the <span>web3</span>, [Blokchain]() technology can now be be applied to many things, Such as many [Decentralized applications(dapp)](https://ethereum.org/id/dapps/#what-are-dapps) that are already exist.
